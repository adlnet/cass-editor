# Importing a Competency Framework  

The process of Importing a new framework is also relatively simple. From
the frameworks tab on the sidebar, users have the ability to view all
existing frameworks within the system. At the top of the page is a list
of options which allow users to import new frameworks into the database
of existing frameworks.

After clicking the import framework button users will be prompted with a
new page where they have the ability to select the source of the
frameworks they are trying to import. Options include: file import,
remote server, paste text and URL source. For file imports, users can
select their desired source and drag the framework into the dotted
window displayed below. Users have the ability to upload csv, json, and
xml files in specific formats. Html, pdf, and docx formats are also
experimentally supported. Example files and templates are linked from
the panel on the right side of the screen.!

Once imported users can select the process files button and the desired
framework will be imported into the your CaSS Authoring Tool database.

The Remote Server option handles imports from IMS CASE repositories, URL
Source handles imports from links to CTDL-ASN JSON-LD graphs, and Paste
Text allows you to input lists of competency names. All import types
have instructions in the panel on the right side of the screen.
