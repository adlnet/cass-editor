## Application Login 

Note: This section is not applicable to Credential Engine instances of
CAT.

By default, most CAT functionality is available without being logged in.
You can search for, create, and manage public frameworks, competencies,
and other CaSS data. Some tools however, will not be available until
after going through the login process.  Accessing secure CaSS data,
securing your own CaSS data, and explicitly granting access and
permissions to owned data all requires you to be logged into the
environment.  (More details about managing user groups and data
permissions can be found in the corresponding sections).

The login button can be accessed through the application navigation
menu.

account to access the CaSS Authoring Tool. At the login page users have
the option to select the create account button shown below.

Creating an Organization, Group, or Team 

Note: This section is not applicable to Credential Engine instances of
CAT.

In CaSS Authoring Tools, user groups provide the capability to assign
multiple users the ability to share permissions across an organization
or team. Members of a group are granted access to any CaSS framework or
competency that the group has been explicitly assigned.
